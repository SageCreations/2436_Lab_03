Lab03 : Arrays vs Linked Lists

There is a video on youtube ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyG9S9nAlUM ) that I found interesting and hope you will too. The publishing - Computerphile - always has great Computer Science topics discussed. Highly recommended. This particular video discusses the performance differences between Arrays and Linked lists. Your assignment is to watch the video and to summarized what you learned. Specifically, I'd like you to think about performance of these 2 data structures in the context of big 'O' notation and how it doesn't fully describe performance in the context of this video. Your report is to be less than one page ( keep it informative, yet concise) and is to be submitted as 'lab03Report.txt' to eCampus.
